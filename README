PAIRGEN
-------
Pairgen is a lightweight tool for autogenerating gpu-accelerated pair styles for LAMMPS.
The input to Pairgen is a yml file containing a data/access pattern and a function body that describes the mechanical model of the pair style.
Pairgen uses string templating to produce two customized gpu-accelerated implementations of the pair style.
We currently support thread-per-atom and block-per-atom decompositions[1].

There are examples in the tests/ directory.
